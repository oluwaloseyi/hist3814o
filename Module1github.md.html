<h2><a id="Module_1_1"></a>Module 1</h2>
<p>Spent a few hours navigating github. I actually found dillinger and markup more straight forward than github. Got frustrated a number of times, and had to go on several walks but hey! I made it to the end of the exercise and Iâ€™m really glad I kept going.</p>
<p>Writing in dillinger; adding links and photos were pretty straight forward once I watched a the videos Prof. Graham had uploaded for us, and I realised using <a href="https://search.creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a> to search for photos that exists on the web already in order to upload them on to markdown.</p>
<p>With github, I got quite a few errors with the codes especially when it got to the pulling requests from a classmate.</p>
